### Location and Installation
Deployed website found here:

The website requires no installation steps from the user. It does require the webpage to be refreshed before each use.

### Purpose of the Project
This is a utility designed to assist users by generating multi-character passwords using lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters. The user may copy the finished password and paste the password into another application.

### Development Aids
I received help on this project chiefly from two people:
1. My classmate Brennan Doehring helped me get started by showing me his random-digit generator. At the end of the project, I helped Brennan by providing coding in the late stage of the work. This was good collaboration.
1. My instructional assistant, Matt Torcelinni, was a steady advisor and helped me overcome coding challenges.

**Project Accomplishments:**
1. Accepts the user's choice of password length, from 8 to 128 characters.
1. The password length choice is validated by the program. The required length between 8 and 128 characters is checked. If a string is entered by the user, the user is notified to select a number.
1. Allows the user to select from four sets of characters: lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters.
1. Contains a vivid developer console for developer use.
1. Reports the final password in a large window from which the user can cut and paste to another application.
1. Code is annotated and semantic.
1. Code is media responsive.
1. Code was validated at W3.org's code validator.

**Project challenges:**
1. Picking a strategy for assembling the password under construction. A concatenation method was used.
1. Presenting the final project in the HTML window provided by the instructions.
1. Validation sequence.
1. A challenge which remains: The website works only if refreshed before multiple uses.
1. Presengting a screenshot of the deployed application. A photo still does not work.
